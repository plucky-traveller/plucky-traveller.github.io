            <p class="card-text">Considering the variety of the items our project involves, we deemed multiple ontologies helpful and decided to combine them in our own new ontological framework for easier representation and interpretation by users. The following word cloud shows the types and frequency of the ontologies we used.</p> 
            <p class="card-text">(word cloud)</p>
            <p class="card-text">We decided to call our new ontology “Plucky” to honor Nellie’s fearlessness. Our ontology allows us to achieve a more complete representation of the relevant information, as it enables to re-use, re-name and re-create predicates from various ontologies, used by various institutions, to increase accessibility and usability. It should be noted that Plucky’s use of the general element “entity” allows us to apply it to a wide variety of items, classified according to their type (Person, Item, Date, Place). Therefore, this means that there is a breadth of predicates that can act on entities of different types.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Person</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Our approach to people was focused on life events, roles, and relations to other people and resources. Using Plucky’s entity type allowed us to discriminate people from other types of entities by using the is_entity_type value “Person”. For us, it was critical to allow our model to represent various names referring to one person, given Elizabeth Jane Cochran choice of Nellie Bly as a name for publications. Specifically, ISAAR 5.1 allowed us to include both authorized and other versions of names for a single person. Additionally, CDWA inspired us to use explicitly defined name types, which allowed us to include a new predicate for a “preferred name”. This was specifically helpful to declare the way scholars have referred to our main person.
              Our utilization of subclasses (as explained in Theoretical Model) was crucial for including complex details. For example. The subclass predicate ‘role_duration’ of the class predicate ‘has_life_role’ allowed us to include greater detail regarding a variety of roles a person might have had. The same logic is true for the utilization of subclasses for the detailed description of events, relationships to resources, and relationships to other persons or corporate bodies. Specifically, the decision to use the event-centric approach for birth, death, crucial meetings, etc., was based on our conceptualization of a life as defined by vital moments. For example, birth became the value of an event with specific details regarding its place and date. In this way, we provided a complete characterization of the person.

            <h5 class="card-title">Date</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              For the format of the date we used the International Standard for the representation of dates and times ISO 8601 specified by the W3Consortium. We decided to include only the year, month and day and not to go further in details as this was enough for representing our items. The formats we used are: YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYY-MM-DD (Y=year, M=month, D=day). To include this information in the XML file we have used the EAC-CPF attribute for Date standardDate, which accepts the formats YYYY, YYYY-MM and YYYY-MM-DD. ISAAR (CPF) International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families has been used for giving information about date and people, such as for identifying people involved in an event occuring on the date. The EAD ontology has been widely used for providing information about the event occurring on the date. We decided to take into consideration the degree of certainty of the date, since given the historical period, the domain of interest and the kinds of resources, we cannot always count on an absolute certain date. The EAD category “Certainty” came into help. We included the meaning of the date’s relation with a resource, agent and event. This information was provided through the use of the CDWA category “Data Qualifier”. According to the general approach of our ontology “plucky”, we enriched each question on event, resource, agent with the questions where, what, which in the attempt to provide an interlinked and consistent framework even when dealing with dates.

            <h5 class="card-title">Place</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              The conceptual model for place aims at depicting specifications related to places. Plucky’s description of places is inspired by GeoName ontology (GN) and Basic Geo (WGS84 lat/long) Vocabulary. These ontologies and vocabularies allowed for detailed description of places, from country location to longitude and latitude, to even population size. Additionally, the GeoNames ontology allows for the inclusion of a link to a location map as well as the place’s wikipedia article.

            <h5 class="card-title">Concept</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              The conceptual model behind the description of concepts prioritizes both breadth of relations as well as detailedness of the relations. In this sense, we decided to continue with the creation of our own ontology with our own elements and predicates while reusing reasoning inherent in RDF, Dublin Core, ISAAR, FOAF, and CDWA, EAD, and CRM. The combinatorial use of these allows our concept or subject elements to be described in high detail. For example, we have included predicates specifically to account for the multiple potential names of one concept, by reusing the RDFs and ISAAR name predicates. While ISAAR is generally used for authority records, we deemed its “Other forms of name” category as a helpful predicate to include. This inclusion allows for a greater linkage of ideas (for example, Technological Revolution is accounted for as another name for the Second Industrial Revolution). We have also included a predicate to describe or include a summary based on the idea behind the Dublin Core’s description predicate. Furthermore, our model allows for a detailed description of places, dates, persons, and events related to the subject or concept in question. As with Persons, the utilization of subclasses is ideal for including greater levels of detail if they are available for each of these relations.
